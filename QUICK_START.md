## 📝 Before Deployment - Required Changes

You MUST update these 2 places with your GitHub information:

### 1. Update `package.json` (line 5)
**Change this:**
```json
"homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-github-repo-name>",
```

**To something like:**
```json
"homepage": "https://johndoe.github.io/mp2",
```

### 2. Update `src/App.tsx` (line 11)
**Change this:**
```tsx
<Router basename="/<your-github-repo-name>">
```

**To something like:**
```tsx
<Router basename="/mp2">
```

## 🌐 Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Create a new PUBLIC repository on GitHub**
   - Name it something like `mp2`
   - Don't initialize with README (it already exists)

2. **Configure GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to repository Settings > Pages
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**

3. **Update your git remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote rename origin old-origin
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   git remote -v  # Verify the change
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete Pokemon Pokedex app"
   git branch -M main
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Wait for deployment (~1 minute)**
   - Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
   - Once complete, visit: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME`

npm install
npm start

Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process

# Or use a different port:
$env:PORT=3001; npm start
```

### Deployment not working
- Verify you updated both `package.json` and `src/App.tsx`
- Check that GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Look at the Actions tab for error messages
- Make sure repository is PUBLIC

### Images not loading
- Check your internet connection
- The PokeAPI might be temporarily down (rare)
- Try refreshing the page

## 💡 Tips

1. **Test thoroughly locally before deploying**
2. **Make sure both config changes are correct**
3. **Use a simple repo name** (like `mp2` or `pokemon-app`)
4. **Watch the GitHub Actions progress** in the Actions tab
5. **The deployment takes about 1 minute** after push
6. **Record your video on the deployed site**, not localhost
