# Pokemon Pokedex - React TypeScript Application

## Overview
This is a comprehensive Pokemon information application built with React, TypeScript, and the PokeAPI. It features three main views for browsing and exploring the first 151 Pokemon.

## Features Completed

### 1. List View (`/`)
The main list view provides a comprehensive Pokemon browser:
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time filtering as you type
  - Search by Pokemon name (e.g., "pikachu", "charizard")
  - Search by ID number (e.g., "25", "6")
- **Sorting Options**:
  - Sort by ID (Pokemon number)
  - Sort by Name (alphabetical)
- **Sort Order**:
  - Ascending (A-Z, 1-151)
  - Descending (Z-A, 151-1)
- **Results Display**: Shows count of filtered results
- **Navigation**: Click any Pokemon to view details

### 2. Gallery View (`/gallery`)
A visual gallery showcasing Pokemon with images:
- **Image Display**: Shows official Pokemon artwork for each Pokemon
- **Type Filtering**: 
  - Filter by single or multiple Pokemon types
  - 18 different types available (Normal, Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, etc.)
  - Color-coded type badges matching Pokemon game colors
  - "Clear All Filters" button to reset
- **Type Badges**: Each Pokemon displays its type(s) with colored badges
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid that adapts to screen size
- **Navigation**: Click any card to view Pokemon details

### 3. Detail View (`/pokemon/:id`)
Comprehensive Pokemon information page:
- **Pokemon Information**:
  - Large official artwork
  - Pokemon number and name
  - Type(s) with color-coded badges
  - Height and weight (converted to meters and kilograms)
  - Abilities list
  - Base stats with visual bar graphs (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed)
- **Navigation Controls**:
  - Previous button (← Previous)
  - Next button (Next →)
  - Circular navigation (wraps from #151 to #1 and vice versa)
  - Back to List button
  - Back to Gallery button
- **URL Routing**: Direct access via URL (e.g., `/pokemon/25` for Pikachu)

## Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used
- **React 19**: Latest React version with functional components and hooks
- **TypeScript 4.9**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **React Router DOM 7**: Client-side routing with clean URLs
- **Axios 1.12**: HTTP client for API requests
- **PokeAPI**: Free Pokemon data API (no key required)

```

### API Integration
The application uses the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2) with the following endpoints:
- `/pokemon?limit=151` - Get list of first 151 Pokemon
- `/pokemon/{id}` - Get detailed information for a specific Pokemon
- `/type` - Get all Pokemon types
- `/type/{name}` - Get all Pokemon of a specific type

### Key Features
- **Client-side Filtering and Sorting**: All filtering and sorting happens in the browser for instant results
- **Efficient Data Loading**: 
  - Initial list loads basic Pokemon data
  - Detailed data loads on-demand for gallery and detail views
  - Batch loading for gallery view performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and missing data
- **Loading States**: User feedback during data fetching
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Design Highlights

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Colors**: Purple gradient (667eea to 764ba2) for headers and navigation
- **Background**: Light gray (#f5f7fa) for subtle contrast
- **Cards**: White with subtle shadows for depth
- **Type Colors**: Authentic Pokemon type colors for badges

### Typography
- **System Fonts**: Uses native system fonts for optimal performance
- **Font Weights**: Varied weights for visual hierarchy
- **Capitalization**: Pokemon names properly capitalized

### User Experience
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle animations on interactive elements
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions for state changes
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of active filters and selected items
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper color contrast

## Getting Started

### Local Development
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mp2-main/mp2-main
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized production build will be in the `build/` directory.

## Deployment Setup

### Prerequisites
Before deploying, you must update two configuration values:

1. **In `package.json`**:
   - Replace `<your-github-username>` with your GitHub username
   - Replace `<your-github-repo-name>` with your repository name

2. **In `src/App.tsx`**:
   - Replace `<your-github-repo-name>` in the Router basename

### Deployment Steps
1. Create a public GitHub repository
2. Configure GitHub Pages to use GitHub Actions (Settings > Pages > Source > GitHub Actions)
3. Push your code to the `main` branch
4. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your app
5. Your app will be live at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>`

See `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed deployment instructions.
